# Advent of code YYYY

## Prerequisite
Must have `gnu-sed` to run `yarn test` or `yarn start`. For mac users, install `gnu-sed` with `brew`.

## No real inputs
No real puzzle inputs are part of this repo. To run with real puzzle input, for example 1a:
- create input file named `input_1a` in `src/1/`, format of input file is just one input per line
- run `yarn start 1a`

## Running the code
Running tests for puzzle 1:
```
yarn tests 1
```


Running the real input for puzzle 1a:
```
yarn start 1a
```
